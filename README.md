# IPTV

IPTV is a Flutter-based application designed to watch television broadcasts from around the world using M3U playlists.

This application uses Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) technology, a method of distributing television content over the internet, rather than through conventional broadcasts such as satellite or cable.

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/fitri-hy/iptv-flutter.git
